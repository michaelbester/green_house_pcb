This is the PCB design for the green house controller.  I used Kicad 6 to design the schematic and layout the board.

The uC pins connected to the fan #2, misc, and vent relays where incorrect.  
I jumpered these pins to unused pins that had output capability, but I can't get the outputs to go high.
